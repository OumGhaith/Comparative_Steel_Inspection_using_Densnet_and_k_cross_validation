# Comparative_Steel_Inspection_using_Densnet_and_k_cross_validation
This repository contains a PyTorch implementation for classifying steel surface defects using the DenseNet121 convolutional neural network. The project demonstrates a comparative approach by integrating k-fold cross-validation to evaluate model performance more robustly across the dataset.
